Was disappointed based upon the prior reviews. ‘Armstrong’ pizza was billed as sausage and meat. Looked like a hot dog was sliced on top and a few pieces of bacon. Much better choices around.,2019-06-28,30,en,[]
685114843,DAE0922BB12703E868929052C6CD433A,7953106,What you’d expect right off the Ramblas,First night in town and getting my bearings. Food was decent but didn’t compare to the restaurants in the neighborhoods like Gracia and off the main strip. Better as a bar than a restaurant. What do you expect right off the touristy drag? Over priced.,2019-06-28,30,en,"['https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/1b/df/dd/photo1jpg.jpg', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/1b/df/de/photo2jpg.jpg', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/1b/df/dc/photo0jpg.jpg']"

685056904,DAE0922BB12703E868929052C6CD433A,11881068,Our best meal in Spain... Hands down.,"Although we didn’t have a reservation, we lucked out on some other cancellation and got a table. Everything was amazing. Specials were mouth watering- venison, rice with chicken shrimp, duck with morels. Appetizers were killer, and the service was the best of all the restaurants we visited.

685532242,DAE0922BB12703E868929052C6CD433A,1228300,Simply amazing.,"Another killer meal of amazing seafood tapas. The honey encrusted Cod, seafood salad, tenderloin bruschetta, and monkfish were all to die for. Very busy but worth sitting at the counter if the wait for a table is too long. And don’t skip the bread pudding.",2019-06-30,50,en,"['https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/21/7a/6c/photo2jpg.jpg', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/21/7a/6a/photo0jpg.jpg', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/21/7a/6b/photo1jpg.jpg', 'https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/21/7a/6d/photo3jpg.jpg']"
